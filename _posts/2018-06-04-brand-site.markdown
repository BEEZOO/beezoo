    <p><abbr>Beezoo</abbr> was approached by PepsiCo to help them launch Lemon Lemon, a new line of sparkling lemonade. We were tasked with developing the Lemon Lemon brand website, which needed to meet PepsiCo’s stringent standards for performance, accessibility, and security. The new site was developed as a custom WordPress theme, and focuses on elevating the brand’s bold packing, while providing a seamless and straightforward experience for visitors. Its simple and elegant design uses full width images and crisp white backgrounds that reflect Lemon Lemon’s focus on natural ingredients and wholesome experiences.</p>
