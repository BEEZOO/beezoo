    <p>Firestone & Robertson Distilling Company is a craft whiskey distillery out of Fort Worth, Texas. As their agency of record in 2017, <abbr>Beezoo</abbr> helped to define the brand’s visual language, while enhancing their online presence. We were responsible for managing F&R’s entire digital strategy, which included redesigning their brand website, introducing video promotion, and developing weekly social content. Over the course of our relationship with F&R, we directed and produced commercials for web and TV, and developed an integrated mixology program for the brand.</p>
