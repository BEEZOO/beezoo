    <h2>Generative Identity + Website Design and Development for <abbr>SAIL</abbr></h2>
    <a href="https://sail.bu.edu/"><span>Visit (sail.bu.edu)</span></a>
  </div>
  <div class="post-intro">
    <p>The Software and Application Innovation Lab is a software development lab within Boston University's Hariri Institute for Computing. In order to attract new students and staff, <abbr>SAIL</abbr> reached out to <abbr>BEEZOO</abbr> to bring a fresh and visually creative approach to their identity and online presence.</p>
    <p>Taking the idea of the combination of visuals and technology, we created an identity system that was visually simple yet offered endless possible iterations. The mark pulls inspiration from international maritime signal flags, also called “code flags,” which are used by ships to communicate at sea. Working off the client request of having a generative element to their identity, we devised the system seen below, which also acted as the new site’s backdrop. The flag customization tool we built in collaboration with SAIL offers visitors the ability to play with <abbr>SAIL’s</abbr> identity, letting each individual take the baseline identity and make it their own in a dynamic and engaging way. The resulting patterns become a graphic representation of SAIL’s creative programming work.</p>
